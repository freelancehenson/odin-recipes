    <h1>Tahu Telor Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tahu Telor is an Indonesian dish consisting primarily of tofu (Tahu) and egg (Telor). There are different types of Tahu Telur but I am sharing my favorite one which comes from my mom’s hometown in Surabaya, Indonesia. Surabaya’s Tahu Telur is served with peanut sauce, which I personally think the best part of this dish. You can use peanut butter with water but I love the aroma of roasted ground nuts so I always make the peanut sauce from scratch.</p>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Main Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pack of firm tofu</li>
        <li>4 large eggs (whisked)</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>Half a teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>Half a teaspoon of black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup of cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Peanut Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100 grams of ground peanut (without skin)</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>Half a teaspoon of garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of lime juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of red onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons of sweet soy souce (kecap manis)</li>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>5 thai chili (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, make the peanut sauce by chopping the ground peanut. Then, use a food processor or a mortar and pestle to combine the chopped peanut with garlic, salt, lime juice, and red onion. If you want the sauce to be spicy, add the thai chili as well. You will end up with a paste-like texture.</li>
        <li>Add water to the peanut paste and mix to dilute it. Add kecap manis (sweet soy sauce) and mix. Then, set the sauce aside.</li>
        <li>Next, dice the tofu into 1 inch cubes and then combine it on a bowl with the whisked eggs. Make sure that the tofu cubes are mixed evenly with the egg and mix minced garlic in. </li>
        <li>In a wok or pan, heat up the cooking oil at medium-high heat. Once the oil is warm, pour the tofu-egg mixture at once and let it fry until the bottom is cooked. You will most likely see bubbles forming on the edge of the egg. </li>
        <li>Once the bottom no longer sticks to the pan, flip the egg and cook for another 1 minute. </li>
        <li>Finally, once the tofu-egg is cooked, take it off the heat and place it on a plate. Pour the peanut sauce over and garnish with fried red onions, bean sprouts and/or kerupuk. Drizzle more kecap manis to your liking. Enjoy! </li>
